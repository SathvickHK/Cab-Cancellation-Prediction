# YourCars Cab Cancellation Prediction

 ## Project Description:
- This project aims to predict the likelihood of cab cancellation for YourCars dataset, using machine learning algorithms. 
- We analyze various factors such as pickup and drop-off locations, type of booking and other features to predict whether a cab booking is likely to be cancelled or completed. 
- The project involves data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and testing. 
- The code and results are documented in the accompanying Jupyter notebook , and the model performance is evaluated using various metrics such as R squared and Adjusted R square scores.
